# Soundgate-Prototype
Soundgate is a game being developed as a obstacle-score based rhythm racer where you can create your own levels with your own music using a built in level editor and share them with friends to play or compete for the highest score possible.

Game Description
Inspired by games such as Riff Racer, Audiosurf, BeatMania, TrackMania, Geometry Dash, Project Arythmia, Touhou, and loads more, Soundgate aims to combine elements of all these games into a rhythm racer where you can enjoy amazing cinematic levels with impactful visuals akin to a AMV or give blood, sweat, and a whole lot of tears to place at the top of some of the hardest levels leader boards. The game is planned to feature highquality handcrafted built in levels apart of a engaging story mode where you must escape a simulator you are trapped in and learn how you ended up inside it. Once you complete the story mode you can let your creativty go wild with a built in level editor where you can import your own MP3 files and build your own levels using track segments of different artistic styles, various soundgates that changes the levels fundamental gameplay mechanics, place all sorts of hazards on or around the track to for the player to avoid, add in various movement triggers and objects to influence the players movement, and create stunning visuals with triggers to move level elements, change lighting and effects, while also placing a unlimited number of decorative geometry, effects, and props to truely make a level fit your imagination to tell a story.

A few examples of planned mechanics and feautes are
-Inverter Suspension (vehicle mode that player can invert on the fly)
-Dagger 102 (a flight mode featuring the F-102 Delta Dagger vehicle with left right up and down mouse control)
-Speed Shift Triggers (changes the players speed when passed)
-Speed Shift Lanes (a lane where the player must hold m1 to maintain speed or they become out of sync and loose the level)
-Dashlane (a lane either on the track or suspended in air where player must hold m1 to dash at the current speed)
-Telegate (a gate that changes the position of the player to another point on the track)
-Move Trigger (a trigger that applys movement and rotation to track elements)
-DDR GH Track Mode (a 4/5 lane track element where the the player must hit the arrow keys or ZXCVB keys in time to the arrows or dots on the track like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero)
-Bullet Hell Mode 
-Timed Turn Base Mode
-Track points (player must position vehicle infront of the points and as the vehicle hits them press mouse 1 or mouse 2 depending on the color to destroy it or the player takes damage)
-Health system (if the player misses a certain amount of points or hits enough hazards the game ends)
-Checkpoint system (if the player dies from running out of health or dies hitting a barrier and a check point is on the level they restart from there)
-Soundgate 
(a gate that when passed through can apply multiple effects such as transporting the player to another place, inverting the player, changing to the Dagger, acts as a checkpoint, adds post processing, and more, essentially doing what every trigger in game can do, it can also be animated using triggers and moved.)  

You can check releases for the project files and builds, since I cant for the life of me figure out how to use github right.

You are free to test the game out and explore its project file and submit fixes for issues that apear during the games developement, you will be credited acordingly. 

Current Uploaded Version: Soundgate Prototype One Version O.1p Created in 6 hours. Finally uploaded after waiting like two weeks because of work.

This version focuses on implementing a mouse-based input/movement system that feels responsive as well as implementing a basic collision detection script and gravity, both of which serve no use in this version, but will be useful later.
